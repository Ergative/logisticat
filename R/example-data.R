#' Data for a hypothetical experiment on time to competence in echinoid larvae.
#'
#' When exposed to potassium chloride, and echinoid larvae will either
#' metamorphose, in which case it has reached metamorphic competence, or it will
#' fail to metamorphose, in which case it is not competent.

#' Note that the total of the "success" and "failure" counts don't need to
#' add up to the same value, they just happen to in this data set.
