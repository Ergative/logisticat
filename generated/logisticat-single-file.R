#' Plot logistic regression of probability from 0% to 100% across a predictor.
#'
#' @param data Data with continuous predictor and success and failure columns.
#' @param predictor Continuous predictor for x-axis.
#' @param success.counts Column representing number of successes per observation.
#' @param failure.counts Column representing number of failures per observation.
#' @param treatment Treatment variable.
#' @param replicate Within-treatment replicates.
#' @param line.var Variable to plot regression curves for: "both" (default),
#'                 "treatment", "replicate", or "none".
#' @param point.var Variable to plot points for: "both", "treatment", "replicate",
#'                  or "none" (default). y-value represents fraction of
#'                  successes in each treatment or replicate.
#' @param boxplot.var Variable to plot boxplots for: "both", "treatment",
#'                    "replicate", or "none" (default).
#' @param inverse.var Variable to draw lines at inverse predictions for:
#'                    "both", "treatment", "replicate", "none" or "line"
#'                    (same as whatever was specified for line.var; default).
#' @param probability.of.interest Calculate predictor value in each group that
#'        would yield this probability.
#' @param xlabel Label for x-axis.
#' @param ylabel Label for y-axis.
#' @param treatment.label Label for treatment.
#' @param treatment.colors Vector mapping treatment levels to colors.
#' @param integer.x.breaks.by If specified, integer breaks in x-axis. Forces
#'        ggplot to break at integer values.
#' @param fill.alpha Opacity in range \[0,1\] for fill of boxplots. Boxplots can
#'                   be hard to see if there is a lot of data, and having a
#'                   light fill color helps to distinguish them.
#' @param jitter.width If specified, amount to jitter points in x-axis. Useful
#'                     if predictor was sampled at discrete steps that would
#'                     otherwise cause points to be hard to tell apart.
#' @param dodge.width If specified, amount to dodge replicate boxplots or groups
#'                    of points by.
#' @param replicate.alpha Opacity in range \[0,1\] to draw `replicate`
#'                        geoms at when the same geom is also drawn for
#'                        `treatment`. Helps distinguish `treatment` from
#'                        `replicate` values.
#' @param inverse.predict.digits Number of digits to print for inverse predicted values.
#'
#' @return A ggplot object.
